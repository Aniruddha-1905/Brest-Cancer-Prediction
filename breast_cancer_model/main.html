                    <p><b>Define cancer :</b><br>
                        Cancer is a disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body.</p>
                    <p><b>Define breast cancer:</b><br> 
                         Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in the breast tissue, often starting in the milk ducts or lobules and potentially spreading to other parts of the body.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Can be classified into 2 Types</b>:</p>
                    <li>Malignant</li>
                    <li>Benign</li>
                    <p> <b>Malignant Breast Conditions</b>:<br>
                        1. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC):
                           - IDC is the most common type of breast cancer, originating in the milk ducts and spreading to surrounding breast tissue.
                           - It often presents as a firm lump or mass in the breast, sometimes accompanied by changes in the skin or nipple.
                        <br>
                        2. Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC):
                           - ILC begins in the lobules of the breast and has a tendency to spread to other parts of the body.
                           - It may not always present as a distinct lump, making it challenging to detect through physical examination alone.
                        <br>
                        3.  Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC): 
                           - TNBC is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression.
                           - It tends to be more aggressive and less responsive to hormone-based therapies compared to other types of breast cancer.
                        <br>
                        4.  HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: 
                           - HER2-positive breast cancer is characterized by overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein.
                           - This type of breast cancer tends to grow and spread more quickly than other types but can be targeted with HER2-targeted therapies.
                        <br>
                        5.  Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS): 
                           - DCIS is a non-invasive form of breast cancer where abnormal cells are found in the lining of the milk ducts but have not spread beyond the ducts into surrounding tissue.
                           - While not life-threatening on its own, DCIS may increase the risk of developing invasive breast cancer if left untreated.
                        <br>
                        <b> Benign Breast Conditions:</b><br>
                        1.  Fibroadenoma: 
                           - Fibroadenomas are non-cancerous breast lumps composed of glandular and fibrous tissue.
                           - They are typically smooth, firm, and mobile, often found in younger women and may change in size over time.
                        <br>
                        2.  Cysts: 
                           - Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the breast tissue, often causing breast lumps that may be tender or painful.
                           - They are more common in women approaching menopause and may fluctuate in size with the menstrual cycle.
                        <br>
                        3.  Fibrocystic Changes: 
                           - Fibrocystic changes refer to non-cancerous changes in breast tissue characterized by the presence of lumps, cysts, and areas of thickening.
                           - Symptoms may include breast pain, tenderness, and swelling, which can vary throughout the menstrual cycle.
                        <br>
                        4.  Adenosis: 
                           - Adenosis is a benign condition characterized by enlarged lobules in the breast tissue.
                           - It may cause breast lumps or nodules and can sometimes mimic the appearance of more serious conditions on imaging studies.
                        <br>
                        5.  Fat Necrosis: 
                           - Fat necrosis occurs when fatty breast tissue undergoes damage or trauma, leading to the formation of scar tissue and nodules.
                           - It can sometimes mimic the appearance of breast cancer on imaging studies but is non-cancerous in nature.</p>
